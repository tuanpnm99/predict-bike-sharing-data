# predict-bike-sharing-data
This is a project from Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree course.


In this project I have built a neural network from scratch to carry out a prediction problem on a real datase. Given the historical data from previous years, I want to predict the number of bikes I need in the bike sharing store at a given day in the year so that I can maximize the customers without losing money from buying too many bikes.
